<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Most Well-Known Test Automation Framework For Selenium Webdriver Tutorial</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In the past few Selenium Webdriver tutorials, we mentioned about different generally and popularly employed commands in Selenium WebDriver Training Online,<a href="http://seleniumwebdrivertrainings.com/selenium-webdriver-training-tutorials-online/" target="_blank"> managing net components</a> like Internet Tables, Frames and managing exceptions in Selenium Webdriver Training scripts.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We mentioned each of the commands with sample code snippets and illustrations in order to allow you to get capable of using all these commands efficiently whenever you're struck with similar scenarios. Amongst the orders we mentioned in the last tutorial, few of these owe extreme significance.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As we move forward in the Selenium Webdriver Tutorial Online string, we'd concentrate our emphasis towards Automation Framework development in another few coming tutorials. We'd also reveal different facets of an Automation framework, kinds of Automation frameworks, advantages of utilizing a framework as well as the fundamental elements that makes up an Automation framework.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>What's Theoretical Model?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A framework Selenium Webdriver Â Tutuorial Online is regarded as a mix of established protocols, principles, criteria and guidelines that may be included or adopted as a complete so as to leverage some great benefits of the scaffolding supplied by the Theoretical Model.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Let's consider a real-life scenario.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We quite frequently use lifts or elevators. There are a number of guidelines these are mentioned inside the lift to be adopted and taken care away so as to leverage the utmost gain and drawn-out service in the machine.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Therefore, the users may have seen the subsequent guidelines:</strong></span></p>

<ul style="text-align: left;">
	<li>Keep a check on the utmost capacity of the lift , nor get onto an elevator in the event the optimum capability h-AS has now reached.</li>
	<li>Press the alarm button in the event of any crisis or problem.</li>
	<li>Enable the passenger to get off the lift if any before going into the lift and stand apparent off the doorways.</li>
	<li>In the event of fire in the building or when there is any haphazard scenario, prevent using lift.</li>
	<li>Don't play or bound in the lift.</li>
	<li>Don't smoke in the lift.</li>
	<li>Phone for the aid/support if do or doesnt open or in the event the elevator doesnt work in any way. Don't attempt to open the doors powerfully.</li>
	<li>There could be several more rules or sets of recommendations. Therefore, these recommendations if adopted, makes the program more valuable, reachable, scalable and less troubled for the customers.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">Now, as we have been referring to Test Automation Frameworks for Selenium Webdriver Tutorial Online, let's transfer our emphasis towards them.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Test Automation Framework:</strong></span></p>

<ul style="text-align: left;">
	<li>A Test Automation Framework for Selenium Webdriver Training is scaffolding which is set to offer an execution environment for the automation test scripts. The framework supplies an individual with various advantages that assists them to create, carry out and report the automation test scripts economically. It's more like a method that's created expressly to Selenium Webdriver Training online automate our evaluations.</li>
	<li>In an extremely plain language, we may state that the framework is a constructive combination of numerous guidelines, coding requirements, theories, procedures, practices, job hierarchies, modularity, reporting mechanics, evaluation information injections etc. to column automation testing. So, person can follow these recommendations while automating program to simply take benefits of varied productive results.</li>
	<li>The edges may maintain different types like simplicity of scripting, scalability, modularity, understandability, procedure definition, reusability, price, care etc. So, in order to catch these advantages, programmers are advised to use one or even more of the Test Automation Framework for Selenium Webdriver Tutorial Online.</li>
	<li>Furthermore, the demand of a solitary and regular Test Automation Framework for Selenium Webdriver Training Online appears if you own a whole lot of software engineers working on different modules of the exact same program and when we wish to prevent circumstances where each of the programmer executes their strategy towards automation.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Note: Have a note a testing framework is obviously program independent that's it may be used with any program irrespective of the issues (such as Technology stack, design etc.) of program under evaluation. The framework needs to be scalable and maintainable.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Benefits of Test Automation framework:</strong></span></p>

<ul style="text-align: left;">
	<li>Reusability of code</li>
	<li>Maximum coverage</li>
	<li>Restoration scenario</li>
	<li>Low cost care</li>
	<li>Minimal manual intervention</li>
	<li>Simple Coverage</li>
	<li>Kinds of Test Automation Framework</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">Now that we've a fundamental notion of what's an Automation Frame-Work for Selenium Webdriver Training Online, in this part we'd harbinger you using the numerous kinds of Test Automation Frameworks those can be found in the market. We'd also attempt shed lights above their advantages and disadvantages and usability tips.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There's a divergent array of Automation Frameworks for Selenium Webdriver Tutorial Online accessible now days. These theoretical models may vary from from each other according to their support to distinct essential elements to do automation like re-usability, ease of care etc.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Let's discuss the few most popularly employed Test Automation Frameworks:</strong></span></p>

<ul style="text-align: left;">
	<li>Module Established Testing Framework</li>
	<li>Library Architecture Screening Framework</li>
	<li>Data Driven Testing Framework</li>
	<li>Keyword Driven Testing Framework</li>
	<li>Hybrid Screening Framework</li>
	<li>Behavior Driven Development Framework</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>1) Module Based Screening Framework</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Module established Testing Framework for Selenium Webdriver Training Online is founded on among the popularly known OOPs theory Abstraction. The framework breaks up the whole Program Under Evaluation into amount of legitimate and remote modules. For every module, we produce a different and impartial test script. Therefore, when these check scripts taken collectively builds a bigger test script representing over one modules.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">These modules are distinguished by means of an abstraction layer in such a means in which the changes produced in the parts of of the program doesnt outputs impacts with this module.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Pros:</strong></span></p>

<ul style="text-align: left;">
	<li>The framework introduces large degree of modularization which results in simpler and cost efficient care.</li>
	<li>The framework is virtually scalable</li>
	<li>In the event the shifts are executed in a single area of the program, just the check script representing that portion of the program must be fixed leaving the rest of the parts unaffected.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></span></p>

<ul>
	<li style="text-align: left;">While executing test scripts for every module individually, we embed the evaluation information (Information with which we should do testing) to the test scripts.</li>
	<li style="text-align: left;">So, if we we're designed to examine using another group of evaluation information, it needs the exploitation to be done in the check scripts.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>2) Library Architecture Screening Framework</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Library Architecture Screening Frame-Work is essentially and foundationally created on Module Based Screening Frame-Work with a few added edges. Rather than breaking up the program under evaluation into test scripts, we segregate the program into functions or fairly common functions may be used by the the rest of the program at the same time.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So we create a standard library making up of typical features for the program under evaluation. Thus, these libraries may be called inside the check scripts whenever needed.The essential essential behind the framework is always to find out the common measures and group them into capabilities under a library and call these features in the check scripts whenever needed.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Pros:</strong></span></p>

<ul>
	<li style="text-align: left;">Like Module Based Frame Work, this framework also introduces higher level of modularization which results in simpler and cost efficient care and scalability too.</li>
	<li style="text-align: left;">As we produce typical features which can be economically utilized by the different test scripts over the Theoretical Model. Hence, the framework introduces an excellent amount of reusability.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></span></p>

<ul>
	<li style="text-align: left;">Like Module Centered Frame Work, the evaluation information is lodged to the test scripts, so any change in the evaluation information would necessitate changes in the check script at the same time.</li>
	<li style="text-align: left;">Together with the introduction of libraries, the framework becomes somewhat complex.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>3) Data-Driven Testing Framework</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">While automating for Selenium Webdriver Tutorial Online or screening any program, at instances it can have to check exactly the same functionality multiple times using the distinct set of input information. So, in such situations, we cant allow the evaluation information embedded in the check script. Therefore it's recommended to keep evaluation information into some exterior data-base outside the check scripts.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Data Driven Testing Framework assists an individual segregate the check script logic as well as the evaluation information from each other. It allows the consumer save the evaluation data into an outside database. The outside databases may be home documents, xml files, excel files, text files, CSV files, ODBC repositories etc. The information is conventionally stored in Key-Value pairs. So, the key may be used to obtain and populate the information inside the check scripts.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Pros:</strong></span></p>

<ul>
	<li style="text-align: left;">The main characteristic of the framework is the fact that it significantly reduces the absolute amount of scripts needed to cover-all the potential combinations of evaluation scenarios.</li>
	<li style="text-align: left;">So smaller quantity of code must analyze an entire group of scenarios.</li>
	<li style="text-align: left;">Any change in the evaluation information matrix wouldn't hamper the check script code.</li>
	<li style="text-align: left;">Increases versatility and maintainability.</li>
	<li style="text-align: left;">One test scenario may be ran changing the evaluation data values.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></span></p>

<ul>
	<li style="text-align: left;">The procedure is complicated and needs an additional effort to develop the evaluation information sources and reading mechanisms.</li>
	<li style="text-align: left;">Demands competence in a programming language that's used to create check scripts.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>4) Keyword-Driven Testing Framework</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The keyword-driven testing framework for Selenium Webdriver Training Online is an expansion to data-driven Testing Framework in a perception that it-not only segregates the evaluation information in the scripts, in addition, it keeps the particular pair of code from the the check script in to an external data file.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">These set of code are identified as Key Words and thus the framework is thus named. Key phrases are self-directing regarding what activities must be done on the program.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The key words as well as the evaluation information are kept in a tabular like construction and therefore it's also popularly thought to be table-driven Theoretical Model. Have a notice that key words and evaluation information are things separate of the automation device being utilized.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Pros:</strong></span></p>

<ul>
	<li style="text-align: left;">As well as edges supplied by Datadriven testing, Key Word powered framework doesnt need an individual to to own scripting information unlike Datadriven Screening.</li>
	<li style="text-align: left;">One key word may be used across several test scripts.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></span></p>

<ul>
	<li style="text-align: left;">An individual needs to be well versed with all the Key Word creation mechanics in order to economically leverage the advantages furnished by the framework.</li>
	<li style="text-align: left;">The framework becomes difficult slowly as it grows and several new keywords are released.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>5) Hybrid Screening Framework</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As the name implies, the Hybrid Screening Frame-Work for Selenium Webdriver Tutorial Online is a mixture greater than one above mentioned frameworks. The most effective thing about this type of set up is the fact that it leverages the advantages of a variety of related frameworks.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>6) Behavior Driven Development Framework</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Behavior Driven Development framework for Selenium Webdriver Training enables automation of functional validations in readily readable and understandable format to Company Analysts, Programmers, Testers, etc. Such theoretical models don't always require an individual to be familiar with programing language. There are various tools available for BDD like cuke, Jbehave etc. Details of BDD framework are mentioned later in Cucumber tutorial.Although the aforementioned pictorial representation of a framework is self explanatory but we'd nevertheless emphasize several points.</p>

<ul style="text-align: left;">
	<li><strong>Object Repository:</strong> Object Repository acronym as OR is made up of the group of locators kinds related to net components.</li>
	<li><strong>Evaluation Information:</strong> The input information with which the situation will be analyzed also it may function as expected values with which the real results will be compared.</li>
	<li><strong>Configuration File/Constants/ Atmosphere Options:</strong> The file save the info about the program URL, browser particular advice etc. It's usually the advice that remains static through the framework.</li>
	<li><strong>Generics/ Software logics/ Visitors:</strong> These will be the types that save the functions which may be generally used throughout the whole framework.</li>
	<li style="text-align: left;"><strong>Assemble applications and Continuous Integration:</strong> These will be the instruments that helps to the frameworks abilities to create evaluation reports, e-mail notifications and logging info.
Decision</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">The theoretical models exemplified above are the most used frameworks for Selenium Webdriver Tutorial utilized by the screening fraternity. There are many other frameworks additionally in the area. For all the additional tutorials we'd base on the Data-Driven Testing Framework for Selenium Webdriver Tutorial Online.</p>
